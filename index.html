    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello there! Thanks for checking out my website!
            <br>
        This page is about me so let me begin telling you about myself...
            <br>
        My name is Fahad, and I enjoy my life here in San Diego. After visiting and living in multiple countries over the course of my life it is clear to me that this is my place to be.
            <br>
        I have spent a few years assisting my family with their business, and have decided to take part in a website development course to learn how to code. I am confident in my ability to learn new material with just the help of the internet, but wanted to really make sure I started the right way to divert from any "beginner mistakes" atleast for my initial exposure.
            <br>
        In my free time I like to listen to podcasts/music and go for a walk. I also really enjoy playing video games with friends I met online (PC of course!).
